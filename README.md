# Data-Science-Projects
The following repository showcases several completed data science projects that demonstrate my proficiency in the field.

# 1) Time Series Forecasting with Python
In this project, I explored the field of time series forecasting using Python. Time series data is a type of data that is collected over time and has a sequential order. Forecasting this type of data can be challenging due to its complex nature and the presence of trends, seasonality, and other patterns.

To address these challenges, I used a variety of techniques and tools, including:

Data preparation and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
Time series decomposition to separate trends, seasonality, and other patterns from the data
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling to make predictions
Model evaluation using various performance metrics
I worked on a real-world dataset when i used to work as a forecast data analyst to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques. The dataset was related to volume of future consumer´s request data for a Company in the Financial Service industry , and I aimed to forecast the consumer´s request in different departments and countries-

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in time series forecasting using Python and learned how to leverage different tools and techniques to make accurate predictions.![decomposed-data_0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108201854/230750611-c02a9c88-085c-45ca-a391-b7fc3365a024.png)

Sure, here's a sample text that you can use:

# 2) Customer Segmentation using Clustering
In this project, I explored the field of customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics or behaviors. This can be useful for businesses to better understand their customers, tailor their marketing strategies, and improve their products and services.

To segment customers, I used clustering techniques, which involves grouping similar customers together based on their similarities or differences in certain features. I used the following techniques:

Data preparation and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
Feature selection and engineering to extract relevant features
Scaling and normalization to ensure fair comparisons
K-means clustering, which involves grouping customers into K clusters based on their similarities in certain features
Hierarchical clustering, which involves creating a hierarchy of clusters based on the similarity of their members

I worked on a real-world dataset since this was in my previous job related with the Financial industry. The dataset contained information on customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and other relevant features. I aimed to segment the customers into different groups based on their similarities in these features.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in customer segmentation using clustering techniques and learned how to leverage different tools and techniques to better understand customer behavior.

# 3) Machine Learning for Visual Recognition of Documents
In this project, I worked on a machine learning project that involved visual recognition of documents. Specifically, the goal of this project was to classify documents into different categories based on their content.

To achieve this goal, I used the following techniques:

Data preparation and cleaning
Text preprocessing and feature extraction to convert the text data into a numerical representation that machine learning models can understand
Model selection and training using various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Model evaluation and optimization using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Deployment of the trained model into a production environment
The dataset used for this project contained documents related to various areas, such as disputes, fraud, special cases, and others. I used keyword extraction techniques to identify the most relevant words and phrases associated with each area and trained the model to classify documents based on these keywords.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in machine learning for visual recognition of documents and learned how to leverage different tools and techniques to classify text data accurately.
