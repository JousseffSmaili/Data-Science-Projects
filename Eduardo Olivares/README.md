# 1) Demand Estimation using Python
In this project, I worked on demand estimation using Python. The goal of this project was to estimate the demand for a universe of 2000 products with varying demands and purchase periods throughout the year. The ultimate aim was to reduce stockout costs and replenishment times.

To achieve this goal, I used the following techniques:

- Data preparation and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
- Time series modeling and forecasting to predict future demand
- Model evaluation and optimization using performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE)
- Deployment of the trained model into a production environment

The dataset used for this project contained information on product demand and purchase periods over a certain time period. I used time series modeling and forecasting techniques to predict future demand and optimize inventory levels.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in demand estimation using Python and learned how to leverage different tools and techniques to improve inventory management and reduce stockout costs.

# 2) Raw Material Inventory Analysis for Product Assembly
In this project, I worked on analyzing the inventory of raw materials required for assembling each product. The aim of this project was to reconcile the finished product stock with the corresponding raw material stock, generating a list of parts required for each product. I used Python, R Studio, and Colab to build the necessary tools and scripts.

To achieve this goal, I used the following techniques:

- Data preparation and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
- Inventory optimization techniques to balance the raw material stock with the finished product stock
- List generation and assembly of parts required for each product
- Iterative process to generate a list of raw materials that need to be purchased
- Deployment of the tools and scripts in a production environment
- The dataset used for this project contained information on the finished product stock and the corresponding raw material stock. I used inventory optimization techniques to balance the stock levels and generate a list of parts required for each product. Additionally, I used iterative processes to generate a list of raw materials that need to be purchased.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in inventory analysis and optimization using Python, R Studio, and Colab. I also learned how to leverage different tools and techniques to optimize inventory levels and streamline production processes.

# 3) Executive Dashboards for Managerial Decision Making
In this project, I worked on building executive dashboards to support managerial decision making. The goal of this project was to generate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each area and present them in a report using Data Studio. The information was extracted from various sources, including databases, plain text, Excel spreadsheets, and ERP systems.

To achieve this goal, I used the following techniques:

- Data extraction from various sources
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Dashboard design and development using Data Studio
- KPI generation and report creation
- Integration of various data sources into a single dashboard

The data used in this project was extracted from various sources and formats, including databases, plain text, Excel spreadsheets, and ERP systems. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I used Data Studio to design and develop the executive dashboard, integrating all the necessary KPIs and metrics for each area.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data integration and dashboard development using Data Studio. I also learned how to leverage different data sources to generate valuable insights and support managerial decision making.
